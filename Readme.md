# Description

Armory is a tool meant to take in a lot of external and discovery data from a lot of tools, add it to a database and correlate all of related information. It isn't meant to replace any specific tool. It is meant to take the output from various tools, and use it to feed other tools.

Additionally, it is meant to be easily extendable. Don't see a module for your favorite tool? Write one up! Want to export data in just the right format for your reporting? Create a new report!

# Installation

## Prerequisites

First, you will require the MySQL db header files for `mysqlclient` which can be installed with the
following commands on the respective hosts:
* Kali: `sudo pt install libmariadb-dev`
* Arch: `sudo pacman -S mariadb-libs`

Afterwards, set up some kind of virtual environment. I like [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## Actually installing

Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/depthsecurity/armory`

Install the module:

`python setup.py install`

You will want to run `armory` at least once in order to create the default config directory: `~/.armory` with the default `settings.ini` and settings for each of the modules.

Next edit *settings.ini* and modify the **base_path** option. This should point to the root path you are using *for your current project*. You should change this with every project, so you will always be using a clean database. All files generated by modules will be created in here, as well as the sqlite3 database. **By default it will be within the current directory-`.`**

# Usage

Usage is split into **modules** and **reports**. 

## Modules

Modules run tools, ingest output, and write it to the database. To see a list of available modules, type:

`armory -lm`

To see a list of module options, type:

`armory -m <module> -M`


## Reports

Reports are similar to modules, except they are meant to pull data from the database, and display it in a usable format. To view all of the available reports:

`armory -lr`

To view available report options:

`armory -r <report> -R`


## Interactive Shell

There is also an interactive shell which uses [IPython](https://ipython.org/) as the base and will allow you to run commands or change database values. It can be launched with: `armory-shell`.
By default, the following will be available: `Domain, BaseDomains, IPAddresses, CIDRs, Users, Creds, Vulns, Ports, Urls, ScopeCIDRs`.
